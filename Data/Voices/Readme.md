# Voice Sample Generation for Speech-to-Text Model Testing using PlayHT 2.0

## Overview

This project uses **PlayHT 2.0** to generate a variety of realistic voice samples for testing different speech-to-text (STT) models. By leveraging PlayHT’s diverse set of voices and customization options, high-quality audio samples were produced to evaluate the accuracy and performance of various STT systems.

## Voice Generation Process

The voice samples were generated using PlayHT 2.0’s text-to-speech functionality. These samples were created with a variety of accents, speech speeds, and tones to provide a robust dataset for testing STT models in different scenarios.

### Steps to Recreate:

### Steps to Recreate:

1. **Prepare Text**: A set of test phrases and sentences was prepared to cover a range of use cases for STT models, including common phrases and complex sentences.
2. **Visit PlayHT**: Go to the [PlayHT 2.0 website](https://play.ht) and log in.
3. **Input Text**: Copy the test phrases into PlayHT’s text-to-speech section.
4. **Voice Selection**: For this project, we used the following PlayHT voices with their default settings:
    - **Nava** (Female, US English)
    - **Madelyn** (Female, UK English)
    - **Michael** (Male, US English)
    - **Oliver** (Male, UK English)
   
    These voices were selected to provide a balanced variety of accents and genders for more comprehensive STT model testing.
5. **Customization**: No customization was applied to the voices. All voices were used with their default settings (default pitch, speed, and tone) to maintain consistency across the samples.
6. **Generate and Export**: Generate the voice samples using PlayHT’s text-to-speech functionality and download the MP3 files for use in STT testing.


## Example Text Used

The example text used to generate the voice samples is provided in the following JSON files:

- `10_words_sample_transcription.json`
- `20_words_sample_transcription.json`
- `30_words_sample_transcription.json`
- `40_words_sample_transcription.json`
- `50_words_sample_transcription.json`

Each file contains sample phrases and sentences with varying word counts, designed to test different speech-to-text models. These samples include both simple and complex sentence structures to cover a wide range of STT use cases.
